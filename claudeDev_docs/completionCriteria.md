This document outlines the clear, prioritized list of project goals and features for the Trip Planning App (MVP).

1. User Input Form:

   - Collect user information: name, age, current location, destination, budget, travel dates, accommodation style, and activities preferences.
   - Implement form validation to ensure all necessary information is provided.

2. Agent-based Trip Planning:

   - Implement multiple agents using CrewAI with clear separation of concerns:
     a. Research Agent: Gather information on flights, accommodations, and activities based on user input.
     b. Budget Agent: Analyze costs and optimize selections within the user's budget.
     c. Itinerary Agent: Create a detailed itinerary based on the optimized selections.
   - Ensure proper communication and data flow between agents.

3. Results Display:

   - Show best flight options with costs.
   - Display recommended accommodations with prices.
   - List suggested activities with associated costs.
   - Present a complete itinerary based on the user's preferences and budget.

4. User Interface:

   - Implement a clean, intuitive UI using Next.js UI Component Library.
   - Create responsive design for various screen sizes.
   - Implement light and dark theme options.

5. Basic Error Handling:

   - Display user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs or system errors.
   - Implement basic error logging on the backend.

6. Data Persistence:

   - Store user inputs and generated trip plans in the database.
   - Allow users to view their past trip plans.

7. Basic Authentication:

   - Implement user registration and login functionality.
   - Secure user data and trip plans.

8. Performance:

   - Ensure reasonable response times for trip planning requests (target: under 30 seconds).
   - Optimize frontend for fast initial load and interaction times.

9. Documentation:

   - Create basic user documentation explaining how to use the app.
   - Provide API documentation for backend endpoints.

10. Testing:
    - Implement basic unit tests for critical frontend and backend components.
    - Perform manual testing of the entire user flow.

The MVP will be considered complete when all these criteria are met and the app is deployed and accessible online.
